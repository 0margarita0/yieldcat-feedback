Suggestions for improving YieldCat platform for students.
## Overview
The **YieldCat** platform provides micro-challenges and tools for students to practice their skills, and it is a great resource for learning. However, as a student, there are a few areas where the platform could be more user-friendly, intuitive, and educational. This repository contains ideas and improvements that could make the platform more engaging and effective.
## Suggestion for Improvement
 **User Interface Enhancements:**
  - Provide a clearer, more intuitive layout for the challenges, making it easier to navigate between different sections (e.g., challenges, leaderboards, progress tracking).
   - Add more visual cues (icons, tooltips) to guide users through complex functionalities.
   - Upon first access to the platform, it was unclear where to start and what exactly needs to be done. The initial experience felt a bit confusing.
 **Challenge Navigation:**
   - After finding the challenges and their requirements, I wasn't aware that the focus was on testing errors and identifying issues in the challenges. It would be helpful to have a clearer indication of what the task's objective is and what to focus on.
**More Interactive Learning Resources:**
   - Introduce interactive tutorials that guide new users step-by-step through the platformâ€™s features and micro-challenges.
   - Offer in-depth examples and solutions for each challenge so that students can learn from mistakes.
